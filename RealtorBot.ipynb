    "    <li>Explore/clean the data</li>\n",
    "    <li>Define the data manipulation functions</li>\n",
    "    <li>Write function specs (although we can tell ChatGPT little white lies on the details)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Create the system content, or context in which ChatGPT operates</li>\n",

    "    </ul>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The above chatbot is very simple, and, as can be seen from the sample conversations, would not be put into production as is. However, the quick development time for such a prototype means that it's not beyond the resources of even small entities to implement their own chatbot.\n",
